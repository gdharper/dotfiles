# arch-dotfiles
Configuration files and scripts for my Arch Linux install.
This is only tested on my 2015 Thinkpad W530 and a baytrail
Chromebook with the MrChromeBox Full ROM fw set.

## General usage for fresh Arch Setup
    1.  Follow guides/arch_install.md to install base arch image.

    2.  Modify config files and script files as desired.
        a.  publish-for-install will copy all files to an installation dir

    3.  Follow guides/arch_setup.md to configure system.

## System Software
These configuration files and scripts are very specificly designed to
setup a fresh Arch install with my personal base toolchain.
